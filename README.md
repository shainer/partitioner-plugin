# partitioner-plugin

Simple partitioner built on top of the library developed in the solid-partitioner repository (see README there for more
information on where to find it).

That library was never integrated into the master branch, and it has not been maintained separately, therefore both of them
are public just for curiosity, as they are not expected to work.
